## Getting Started

Check out the [live demo](https://ryanjmack.github.io/Global-Surface-Temperature/)!

This project is *not* responsive. The nature of the visualization is best viewed on larger devices.

# Global Surface Temperature

This is a simple data visualization project I created using a dataset I found from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/background) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) using the popular data visualization library [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

I wanted to use an up to date dataset for my visualization and I found one that is current to May 2018. I sanitized the data using some scripts and stored in it in a JavaScript file. The graph aims to show the degree of variance of average monthly land temperature compared to the 20th century average; the graph shows data from 1880 to 2018. You can notice how there is a decent amount of temperature variance at the ends of the graph. The late 19th century was cooler, and the early 21st century was warmer.

An interesting thing to note about temperature change on a worldwide scale is that "A half degree averaged out over the whole world can mean much more of an increase in some locations and at certain times" [source - nasa](
https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2458/why-a-half-degree-temperature-rise-is-a-big-deal/).

A heatmap data visualization tells a different story about how the climate is changing. 

## Built With

* HTML/SCSS
* ES6 JavaScript
* D3.js
* Gulp for automating tasks


## Final Thoughts
D3 is starting to become a bit more intuitive for me, although there's always something more to learn!
